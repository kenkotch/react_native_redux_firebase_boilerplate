# React-Native Redux Firebase Boilerplate with Express API

* Boilerplate code for firebase authentication with react-native using redux

* If the sign-in action fails, it automatically signs up a new user. You will want to separate those.

* The 'common' components are heavily inspired by Stephen Grider.

* If you are not into linting, remove the eslint lines from package.json and delete .eslintrc

## Usage
* In ReactNative folder, yarn install, then add firebase config to App.js then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` from terminal

* turn on remote debugging to see success message in console

* In API folder, yarn install, then add firebase-adminsdk.json and database url to authRoutes.js
